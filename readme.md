> **Inspired by Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend and the simple joy of earning amusement park tickets**

HelpToken is cryptocurrency designed to improve local government by rewarding people for helping their community. Volunteer for your city, earn HELP tokens, spend them on local benefits. It's that simple.

If you would like to see a front end demo of how this would look, here it is: https://github.com/NateIsTrying/Help-Token-Demo-8-10-25/tree/main

## 💡 The Big Idea

Remember earning tickets at Chuck E. Cheese? You played games, got tickets, traded them for prizes. HelpToken works the same way, but instead of skee-ball, you're helping your community for tokens for coffee or movie tickets.

**The Vision:**
- **Volunteer** → Clean parks, tutor kids, help seniors
- **Earn HELP tokens** → Verified by local government
- **Spend tokens** → Bus passes, parking, rec center access, local discounts

Think of it as Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend, but you earn it by making your city better.

## 🏛️ How It Actually Works

**Local Committees Decide Everything**
- City council members + nonprofit leaders form committees
- They decide what volunteer work is needed most
- They set token rewards based on community impact
- They choose what benefits you can buy with tokens

**Real Examples:**
- Clean up downtown → Earn 5 HELP → Buy free parking for a week
- Tutor at library → Earn 15 HELP → Get recreation center membership
- Help at food bank → Earn 10 HELP → Free bus pass

## 🚧 Project Status

**⚠️ This repo is incomplete and under active development.**

We're building:
- ✅ Smart contracts for the HELP token
- ✅ Web app for volunteers and city staff
- ✅ Municipal admin tools
- 🚧 Integration with city systems
- 🚧 Mobile app
- 🚧 Pilot city partnerships

**Coming Soon:** A live demo will be posted so you can see what the finished app looks like in action.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Most crypto is speculation. HelpToken solves real problems:

- **For Cities:** Get more volunteers, save money, engage citizens
- **For Volunteers:** Get rewarded for helping (beyond just feeling good)
- **For Everyone:** Stronger communities with measurable impact

## 🏙️ Perfect for Mid-Size Cities

We're targeting cities like:
- Burlington, VT (44K people)
- Chattanooga, TN (180K people)  
- Fort Collins, CO (170K people)

Big enough to matter, small enough to actually implement.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Frontend:** Next.js + React (the volunteer app)
- **Backend:** Node.js + PostgreSQL (city admin tools)
- **Blockchain:** Polygon network (eco-friendly, cheap transactions)
- **Security:** Multi-signature verification (prevents fraud)
